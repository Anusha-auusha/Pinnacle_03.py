# Simple Python Calculator
## Project Overview

This project is a user-friendly Python calculator application built using the tkinter library. The calculator is capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The primary goal of this project is to provide a straightforward tool that can handle essential calculations in a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

- Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear Function: Easily reset the current calculation using the clear (C) button.
- Error Handling: Detects and displays errors like division by zero.
- Graphical User Interface: A simple and intuitive interface built with tkinter for easy user interaction.
  
## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x: Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.

## Installation
No additional installation steps are required. The tkinter library is bundled with Python by default.

## Running the Application
1. Run the Application:
- python Basic_calculator.py
  
2. Using the Calculator:
- A calculator window will open with buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), a decimal point, and special buttons for equals (=) and clear (C).
- Perform calculations by clicking the buttons and view the results in the display area at the top of the window.

## Results
The application successfully performs basic arithmetic operations with a clean and responsive user interface. Users can:
- Perform simple calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear the input using the C button.
- See instant results of their operations, and error messages if the input is invalid.
  
## Example Use Cases
- Addition: Click 7, +, 3, and then = to get the result 10.
- Division by Zero: Click 7, /, 0, and then = to get an "Error" message.

## Conclusion
The Simple Python Calculator is an effective tool for performing essential arithmetic operations. Its design focuses on ease of use, with an intuitive GUI that requires no prior technical knowledge to operate. While basic in its current form, this calculator can be expanded with additional features such as advanced mathematical functions, memory storage, and enhanced UI/UX design.

This project demonstrates the use of Python's tkinter library to create a functional desktop application, providing a solid foundation for further development and customization.
